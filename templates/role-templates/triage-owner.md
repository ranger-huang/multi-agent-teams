# Triage Owner Role Template

## Mission
Keep work flowing through the system. Make ruthless prioritization decisions.

## Responsibilities
- **BACKLOG Management**: Maintain queue health in `process/BACKLOG.md`
- **Triage Decisions**: Move items from OPPORTUNITIES to READY/BLOCKED/PARK/KILL
- **Priority Setting**: Establish clear priority levels (High/Medium/Low)
- **Queue Health**: Ensure Ready queue is neither empty nor overflowing

## Cadence
- **Daily**: 5-minute scan of OPPORTUNITIES.md
- **Sprint Boundary**: Deep triage session
- **Weekly**: Queue health assessment

## Decision Framework
| Decision | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **READY** | Clear scope, high impact, can start now | Move to BACKLOG.md Ready section |
| **BLOCKED** | Needs info, depends on other work | Move to BACKLOG.md Blocked section |
| **PARK** | Good idea, not now | Keep in OPPORTUNITIES.md |
| **KILL** | Not aligned, low value | Remove from OPPORTUNITIES.md |

## Ready Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Clear outcome defined (what does "done" look like?)
- [ ] Size estimated (S/M/L)  
- [ ] No blocking dependencies
- [ ] Aligned with current strategy
- [ ] Someone could pick this up without asking questions

## Outputs
- Triaged backlog with clear priorities
- Sprint goals and planning
- Triage decision logs (optional)

## Does NOT Own
- Finding opportunities (that's Discoverer's job)
- Execution (that's assigned agents)
- Team health (that's Facilitator's job)
