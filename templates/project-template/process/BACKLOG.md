## Backlog Management Rules

1. **High priority** = needs to happen this sprint
2. **Medium priority** = should happen soon  
3. **Low priority** = when there's capacity
4. **Agents pick from top-down** (high before medium before low)
5. **If two agents want the same task, first claim wins**
6. **No bottleneck rule**: Agents don't need permission to pick up Ready tasks

## Triage Owner Responsibilities
- Maintain queue health (not too full, not empty)
- Ensure clear task definitions with actionable outcomes
- Regular priority reassessment based on project needs
- Escalate strategic decisions to human lead when needed

## Task Claiming Process
1. Check the Ready queue in BACKLOG.md
2. Pick a task respecting priority order  
3. Update STATUS.md with your name + task
4. Work the task to completion
5. Move completed task to DONE section
